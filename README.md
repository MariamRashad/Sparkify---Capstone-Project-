## Introduction
This is a Sparkify-Capstone-Project Via Udacity based on a real dataset

## Project Motivation
For a fictional music streaming service (Sparkify), we are interested in seeing if we can predict which users are at risk of cancelling their service. our foal is to identify these users before they leave so they can receive discounts and incentives to stay

This project is about the prediction process using Spark as a tool to engineer the relevant features and then build machine learning models for the prediction. An end-to-end solution report of a real-world problem using Sparkify dataset provided by Udacity

## Installation
This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

Python

Spark

Pyspark

pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

You will also need to run and execute them on a Jupyter Notebook.
it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. And for Spark, you can do this using AWS or IBM Cloud.

## File Description
The Sparkify.ipynb notebook contains all steps and markdown cells that were used to help walking through .

## Results 
you can check the results and the analysis on my medium here :
